      <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>This To-Do App was born out of my own need for a clean,
         no-nonsense task manager — and as a hands-on project during my learning journey
         in full-stack development.Starting with the basics of backend and frontend technologies,
         I built this app from the ground up to practice real-world skills: creating secure APIs,
         designing responsive interfaces, and managing user data safely.
         The result is a minimal yet powerful tool that makes tracking daily tasks feel effortless.
        </p>
